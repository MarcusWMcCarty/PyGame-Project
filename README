    In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. 
    The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. 
    When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fill the sky and moves across and down the screen. 
    The player shoots and destroys the aliens.
    If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves fasetr than the previous fleet. 
    If any alien hits the players ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.
    If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
